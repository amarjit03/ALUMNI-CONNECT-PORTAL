<summary><h2>🔍 Problem Statement</h2></summary>

> "Across campuses, students struggle to find direction — not because they lack ambition, but because they lack access to the right guidance. Alumni, who've already walked the path, are eager to give back — but they lack a structured and meaningful way to do so."

Current educational systems and alumni networks face several challenges:

<div align="center">
<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">🧭</td>
    <td><b>Guidance Gap</b>: Students lack personalized mentorship tailored to their unique paths</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">🔄</td>
    <td><b>Fragmented Resources</b>: Career opportunities, learning resources, and networking are scattered across platforms</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">📚</td>
    <td><b>Outdated Systems</b>: Traditional learning methods fail to engage today's digital-native students</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">🚪</td>
    <td><b>Limited Opportunities</b>: Students struggle to find meaningful internships, jobs, and real-world experiences</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">🖥️</td>
    <td><b>Technical Barriers</b>: Lack of AI-driven tools for collaborative learning and skill development</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">🌐</td>
    <td><b>Accessibility Issues</b>: Digital divide prevents equal access to quality education and networking</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

This disconnect leads to missed mentorship, lost opportunities, and students left to navigate their futures alone.
